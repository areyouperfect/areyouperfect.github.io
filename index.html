                <p>I am Natalie Lam and I am 16 years old. I am now a Form 4 student of Sacred Heart Canossian College English Section and I am in the Business stream. I like to listen to music and watch TikTok when I am free. My favourite subject is music and PE and my favourite colour is red. I am having a piano lesson every Saturday and  I will have a piano grade 8 exam next year.</p>
                <p>I am a fan of Jackson Yee. He is a very handsome and talented boy who was born in 2000. He had said a sentence that is very significant. He said that don't blindly take a person as your goal. What you need to do more is to understand yourself, and become the person you want to be.</p>
